# GTD (Getting Things Done) Stuff

Although I am a huge fan of [todo.txt ](http://todotxt.org/) format for my GTD procedure, I decided to see If I can do the same with a custom spreadsheet.

Most of the templates I found online were bloated, so I decided to make my own.

The structure of this sheet is exactly the same as with [todo.txt ](http://todotxt.org/):

- a simple list for everything
- optional due dates
- projects only when something needs more than one action to be completed 
- priorities (I use from A to C)


Please note that I still use (and will continue to use) [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/). This spreadsheet is just an experiment!

## Workflow

### New additions

- Just go to **Main** sheet and add your task on a new line.
- Choose the appropriate context (calls, emails, errands etc) or  list (inbox, someday/maybe etc).
- Put either a priority or a due date - although you can, don't put both
- Optionally, write any note on the **notes** column. I only put a number and I then create a txt file with the same number as a name (ex. 02.txt)

### Filtering

You can use the filtering capabilities to sort per anything you like, ex priority, or context or both or...

A suggested workflow would be the following:

1. sort by **inbox** context/list and modify lines so that they get their actual context (ex. calls)

2. sort by **priority A**  (priority A are stuff I need to do today in my system)

3. sort by **due today** (to see stuff that MUST be done today, ex. appointments)

All lines that are **due today** or have an **A priority** are already bold and highlighted using a **yellowish color**.

If a task is overdue, the **due date cell** will be highlighted with a  **reddish** color.


### Task completion

- When a task is completed, just put a  **x** in **done** section and the date in **completion date** column. You will notice that as soon as you put the x, a **strikethrough formatting** is applied through the whole line and all coloring is removed (all line text becomes **black**).
- At a later stage, just cut all completed lines (you can sort **done** columm per lines that include x) and paste them in **Archive** sheet.

## Notes

- Don't use due dates if you want something be done on a specific date. Use them **only if it MUST**.

- Use your own priorities. I use from A to C (and sometimes D):

>- **A** for tasks that are to be completed **today** (red colored)
>- **B** for tasks that are to be completed within the **next 2-3 days** (orange colored)
>- **C** for tasks that are to be completed within the **next 7 days** (green colored)

- Being used to the simplicity of [todo.txt ](http://todotxt.org/), I don't keep separate lists for inbox, ticklers, someday/maybe, goals etc. Everything is kept on a single list and all these "special lists" are treated like contexts.
So, instead of sorting per ex. calls, to see the calls you have to make, you can sort per **ticklers** or per **inbox** or....  
A single list for everything **is far easier and simpler** to maintain and **simplicity** is one of the most important prerequisites for a **successful GTD system**.
